= Fastruby - fast execution of ruby code

Fastruby is a gem which allows to execute ruby code faster than normal (about 20X of the MRI1.8)

Fastruby IS NOT a separated ruby interpreter. Then, the design is simple

Fastruby IS NOT a DSL to generate C code using ruby or a Ruby to C translator, the goal of fastruby is to execute RUBY code

*************************************************************************************************************

The current version of fastruby is a Proof of Concept and it's not ready to go to production

*************************************************************************************************************

== Core Concepts

=== Native build

All code processed by fastruby ends with a native representation, in the current version, this is acomplished using RubyParser to parse rubycode. 
The ruby code is translated to C and then processed with RubyInline

=== Transparent multimethods (and multiblocks)

The methods processed by fastruby has multiple internal implementations depending on the type of the arguments. 
Each possible signature has a version of the method and this are built in runtime when the method is called with a new signature.
The same concept will be applied to blocks (anonymous methods) in future releases

=== Type inference

Each version of a method is built for a specific signature, so, the builder can asume a type for the arguments and build method calls using that assumption.
Whereever the translator can asume a type for a expression involved in a method call (used as argument or as receiver), this information can be used to encode 
direct calls instead of normal and expensive ruby calls.

The currently implementation only can infer types for method and block arguments, and for literals

=== Customization through build directives and API

To compensate for the described limitations, fastruby suport a few build directives to allow the programmer help the inference.
The syntaxis of these directives are the same as normal ruby call (see examples)
Also, fastruby will define a API to customize aspects of fastruby internals. E.g the build method to invoke the build of methods with a specific signature (see examples)

== Installation

The install is as simple as execute the well-known gem install:

sudo gem install fastruby

== Documentation

Overhead due new frame structure of reduce the speed to 20x (previously was near 100X). This refactor was necessary 
to implement most of the common ruby constructions (blocks, yields, breaks, next, exceptions, etc...)
Since this first version of fastruby is in part an spike/PoC, there is no stable API to document. 
So, I recommend not to develop other software on top of fastruby since its API could change in any moment. 
But I will try as much as possible keep the backward compatibility in the near future

I will stabilize the API and document it for next releases. I promise

== Known Limitations & Issues

* monkey patching does not work with fastruby methods
* callcc is not supported, it works but using it may result in unexpected behaviour
* recursive methods will be slow since the optimization of method calls only works with already defined methods
* calls with blocks to ruby or cruby methods are almost as slow as normal ruby (if the called method is defined by fastruby, the call it's pretty fast)

== Usage

=== Environment variables

FASTRUBY_LOG			define the output file of logging (default is standard output)
FASTRUBY_LOG_LEVEL	define the logging level (default 3)
FASTRUBY_NO_CACHE	set to 1 to disable the cache globally

=== Fastruby options

This options can be passed to fastruby when defining fastruby blocks

:no_cache				set to true to disable cache (default: false)
:validate_lvar_vars		enable runtime check of assignments of typed variable (default: disabled)

== Code Examples

The basic method is fastruby, fastruby takes a string with ruby code and compile it

=== Example 1: How invoke fastruby

  require "fastruby"
  
  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo
      print "hello world\n"
    end
    '
  end
  
  X.new.foo
  
=== Example 2: Prebuild

Normally, the method is built at runtime when is called with a new signature, You can prebuild the method to prevent this when the method is called for first time

  require "fastruby"
  
  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo(a,b)
      a+b
    end
    '
  end
  
  X.build([X,String,String] , :foo)
  
  p X.new.foo("fast", "ruby") # will use the prebuilded method
  p X.new.foo(["fast"], ["ruby"]) # will build foo for X,Array,Array signature and then execute it

=== Example 3: Explicit inference

Current fastruby allows to explictly define a type for a expression, a basic example show as tell to fastruby to assume that the result of to_s is of type String in the following case:

  require "fastruby"
  
  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo(a)
      a.to_s.infer(String) + "_"
    end
    '
  end
  
  p X.new.foo(9) 

When fastruby can infer the type of an expression, the method calls that involve that expression can be accelerated. This is not necessary for arguments passed to a method or block

=== Example 4: Variable types

Like static languages, you can define a type for a variable to help the inference and gain some performance. This can be done by using lvar_type directive

  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo
      lvar_type(i, Fixnum)
      i = 100
      while (i > 0)
	i = i - 1
      end
      nil
    end
    '
  end
  
With no lvar_type, the calls to Fixnum#> and Fixnum#- will be dynamic and more expensive
