Refactor:

* hashes of methods on builder refactored into an only hash
* refactor anonoymous methods (tip: use ruby format string for names)
* Clean of duplicated code
* Remove ruby inline explicit dependency

Basic functionality:

* Control setences: if, case, rescue, ensure, etc...
* Defining and call of methods with variable number of arguments
* Blocks with variable number of arguments

Improves:

* Fastruby builds himself to improve performance of dynamic builds
* Multiblocks: multiple transparent block implementations for the same block
* Fastruby method allow defining many methods in only one call and allow define classes
* RubySpec: make code executed by fastruby pass RubySpec
