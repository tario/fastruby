Basic functionality:

* Flow control setences: case
* Exceptions
* Defining and call of methods with variable number of arguments
* Blocks with variable number of arguments
* call to monkey patched methods from fastruby code
* callcc

To improve:

* Inlining of methods
* Error check (e.g. calling a directive with invalid parameters)
* Fastruby builds himself to improve performance of dynamic builds
* Multiblocks
* Fastruby method allow defining many methods in only one call and allow define classes
* Oracle testing using normal ruby as oracle
* Inference using "return types" of methods when the implementation of the method is known
* RubySpec: make code executed by fastruby pass RubySpec

Refactor:

* hashes of methods on builder refactored into an only hash
* refactor anonoymous methods (tip: use ruby format string for names)
* Clean of duplicated code
* Remove ruby inline explicit dependency

Documentation:

* Builder directives
* Build API
