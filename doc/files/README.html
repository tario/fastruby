      <h1>Fastruby - fast execution of ruby code</h1>
<p>
Fastruby is a gem which allows to execute ruby code faster than normal
(about 100X of the MRI1.8)
</p>
<p>
Fastruby IS NOT a separated ruby interpreter. Then, the design is simple
Fastruby IS NOT a DSL to define C code or a Ruby to C translator, the goal
of fastruby is to execute RUBY code
</p>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<h3>Native build</h3>
<p>
All code processed by fastruby ends with a native representation, in the
current version, this is acomplished using RubyParser to parse rubycode.
The ruby code is translated to C and then processed with RubyInline
</p>
<h3>Transparent multimethods (and multiblocks)</h3>
<p>
The methods processed by fastruby has multiple internal implementations
depending on the type of the arguments. Each possible signature has a
version of the method and this are built in runtime when the method is
called with a new signature. The same concept will be applied to blocks
(anonymous methods) in future releases
</p>
<h3>Type inference</h3>
<p>
Each version of a method is built for a specific signature, so, the builder
can asume a type for the arguments and build method calls using that
assumption. Whereever the translator can asume a type for a expression
involved in a method call (used as argument or as receiver), this
information can be used to encode direct calls instead of normal and
expensive ruby calls.
</p>
<p>
The currently implementation only can infer types for method and block
arguments, and for literals
</p>
<h3>Customization through build directives and API</h3>
<p>
To compensate for the described limitations, fastruby suport a few build
directives to allow the programmer help the inference. The syntaxis of
these directives are the same as normal ruby call (see examples) Also,
fastruby will define a API to customize aspects of fastruby internals. E.g
the build method to invoke the build of methods with a specific signature
(see examples)
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The install is as simple as execute the well-known gem install:
</p>
<p>
sudo gem install fastruby
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
Since this first version of fastruby is in part an spike/PoC, there is no
stable API to document. So, I recommend not to develop other software on
top of fastruby since its API could change in any moment. But I will try as
much as possible keep the backward compatibility in the near future
</p>
<p>
I will stabilize the API and document it for next releases. I promise
</p>
<h2>Known Limitations &amp; Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>monkey patching does not work with fastruby methods

</li>
<li>does not support singleton methods (both define &amp; call)

</li>
<li>does not support methods with variable number of arguments

</li>
<li>does not support exception handling (rescue, ensure, etc&#8230;)

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The basic method is fastruby, fastruby takes a string with ruby code and
compile it
</p>
<p>
There is a few known limitations:
</p>
<pre>
  * fastruby can't take more than one method
  * fastruby only can be called from inside a class scope, and only can be used to define instance methods (no class methods)
</pre>
<h3>Example 1: How invoke fastruby</h3>
<pre>
  require &quot;fastruby&quot;

  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo
      print &quot;hello world\n&quot;
    end
    '
  end

  X.new.foo
</pre>
<h3>Example 2: Prebuild</h3>
<p>
Normally, the method is built at runtime when is called with a new
signature, You can prebuild the method to prevent this when the method is
called for first time
</p>
<pre>
  require &quot;fastruby&quot;

  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo(a,b)
      a+b
    end
    '
  end

  X.build([X,String,String] , :foo)

  p X.new.foo(&quot;fast&quot;, &quot;ruby&quot;) # will use the prebuilded method
  p X.new.foo([&quot;fast&quot;], [&quot;ruby&quot;]) # will build foo for X,Array,Array signature and then execute it
</pre>
<h3>Example 3: Explicit inference</h3>
<p>
Current fastruby allows to explictly define a type for a expression, a
basic example show as tell to fastruby to assume that the result of to_s is
of type String in the following case:
</p>
<pre>
  require &quot;fastruby&quot;

  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo(a)
      a.to_s.infer(String) + &quot;_&quot;
    end
    '
  end

  p X.new.foo(9)
</pre>
<p>
When fastruby can infer the type of an expression, the method calls that
involve that expression can be accelerated. This is not necessary for
arguments passed to a method or block
</p>
<h3>Example 4: Variable types</h3>
<p>
Like static languages, you can define a type for a variable to help the
inference and gain some performance. This can be done by using lvar_type
directive
</p>
<pre>
  class X
    fastruby '
    def foo
      lvar_type(i, Fixnum)
      i = 100
      while (i &gt; 0)
        i = i - 1
      end
      nil
    end
    '
  end
</pre>
<p>
With no lvar_type, the calls to Fixnum#&gt; and Fixnum#- will be dynamic
and more expensive
